        "Loops\n",
        "SASS also supports loops, which allows for repeated CSS declarations to be generated based on a set of values. This can be useful for generating a large number of CSS rules with similar properties. Here is an example of how to use a loop to generate a set of classes with increasing font sizes:\n",
        "@for $i from 1 through 5 {\n",
        "\n",
        ".font-#{$i} {\n",
        "\n",

        "}\n",
        "\n",
        "}\n",
        "\n",
        "This will generate the following CSS:\n",

        "Functions\n",
        "SASS also has a number of built-in functions that can be used to manipulate values. For example, the lighten() function can be used to lighten a color by a certain percentage. Here is an example of how to use the lighten() function:\n",

        "\n",
        ".secondary-color {\n",

        "\n",
        "}\n",
        "\n",
        "This will generate CSS that sets the background-color of .secondary-color to a lighter version of the $primary-color variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mixins with Arguments\n",
        "Mixins in SASS can also take arguments, which allows for more dynamic styling. Here is an example of a mixin that takes a color and font size as arguments:\n",
        "@mixin heading($color, $size) {\n",
        "\n",
        "color: $color;\n",
        "\n",
        "font-size: $size;\n",
        "\n",
        "}\n",
        "\n",
        "This mixin can then be used to generate styles for different headings, with different colors and font sizes. Here is an example of how to use the heading mixin:\n",
        "\n",
        "h1 {\n",
        "\n",
        "@include heading(#4CAF50, 24px);\n",
        "\n",
        "}\n",
        "\n",
        "h2 {\n",
        "\n",
        "@include heading(#2196F3, 20px);\n",
        "\n",
        "}\n",
        "\n",
        "h3 {\n",
        "\n",
        "@include heading(#9C27B0, 16px);\n",
        "\n",
        "}\n",
        "\n",
        "Operators\n",
        "SASS supports a number of operators that can be used to manipulate values. For example, the + operator can be used to add values together. Here is an example of how to use the + operator:\n",
        "$font-size: 14px;\n",
        "\n",
        "h1 {\n",
        "\n",
        "font-size: $font-size + 2px;\n",
        "\n",
        "}\n",
        "\n",
        "This will generate CSS that sets the font-size of h1 to 16px.\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, SASS is a powerful tool that extends the functionality of CSS. It offers features such as variables, loops, functions, mixins with arguments, and operators that allow for more dynamic and efficient styling. By using SASS, you can write more concise and maintainable stylesheets that are easier to work with and modify."
