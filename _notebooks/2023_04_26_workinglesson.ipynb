        "- What are Lists?\n",
        "    - Lists are an ordered sequence of elements, where each element is a variable\n",
        "    - Unlike dictionaries, lists' keys are all integers that describe the order of the list\n",
        "\n",
        "Some examples of lists:\n",
        "-  Playlist of songs\n",
        "-  names of students in a class\n",
        "-  contacts on your phone\n",
        "\n",
        "- Each element of a string is referenced by an index (which is a number) and they generally start 0 but for the AP Exam it starts at 1.\n",
        "    - AP Exam: 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.\n",
        "    - Python:  0, 1, 2, 3, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How do lists Manage Complexity of a program?**\n",
        "- We may not need as many variables. For example:\n",
        "    - One Variable that holds all students would be better than having a variable for EACH student\n",
        "    - There can also be a list of test scores so if they need to be curved then the same calculation can be applied to the list (that has all the students) instead of doing the calculations one at a time\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer the following questions about the code block below:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Why do you think lists are helpful? What word does College Board like to use to describe the function of lists?\n",
        "\n",
        "Lists are helpful in programming because they allow us to store and manipulate a collection of items or values. Lists enable us to perform operations such as adding or removing elements, accessing specific elements by index, and iterating over all elements. The College Board likes to use the term \"abstraction\" to describe the function of lists in programming. Lists abstract away the details of how the individual elements are stored in memory, allowing programmers to work with collections of elements as a single entity. This makes it easier to write and understand code that deals with multiple values at once, without having to worry about the low-level details of how they are represented in the computer's memory."
