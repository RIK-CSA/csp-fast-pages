# Skills you have obtained
I have obtained the skill of leadership, as I was the Scrum Master of the RECS group in the second trimester of this year as well as the Dev Ops Lead of the Hectic 6 group in the third trimester of the year. In the former experience, I was responsible for delegating group duties to the rest of my group members and unifying my group members around a central goal, which wasn't easy compared to other groups given that unlike other groups, my teammates didn't personally know each other initially. In addition, I've learned how to facilitate frontend, backend, and Dev Ops in a major team to the standards of a professional website. 
# Highs and lows from year
Highs: I took on a massive leadership role in my Trimester 2 group and pulled through with a great project, including several features integrated with APIs coming from important organization such as OpenWeatherMap.
Lows: There were definitely some late nights full of stress, but in the end I managed to pull through. One example is when my first trimester AWS deployment was going off the rails and our devops and I couldn’t figure out anything that would fix it (this was before ChatGPT). We were able to redo the entire deployment and luckily it worked after that.
# Future plans with CompSci and Education/Career
I have decided on a year-long internship for next year. One of my family friends is the director of the San Diego Supercomputer Center and is looking for Comp Sci interns, and most of my other family friends have gone to him for CS internships and experience. I’m also planning on minoring in Data Science or pursuing in some way after high school. I don’t know if I’m committed enough to be a Comp Sci major, because I’m very interested in Data Science and it is a less competitive major in general, but I definitely want to pursue both interests. In terms of education, I strive for a BS in Computer Science and something in Data Science as well. To be honest, I haven’t thought very long or hard about my entire career, but I also know I have a lot of time to experiment in my life.
# other, you pick
I have learned a lot from the culture of CS at Del Norte. One aspect that I love the most is the increased presence of project-based learning rather than pencil-on-paper tests. That allows me to understand skills that will be needed in the workplace better.
