Personal finance manager: Create a program that help users manage their finances by tracking expenses, creating budgets, and generating reports. The program can use APIs to retrieve financial data and store it in a database.

Language larning app: Design a mobile app that helps user learn a new language by providing vocabulary lists, quizzes, and games. The app can use text-to-speech and speech-to-text features to aid pronunciation and conversation practice.

Social media platform: Build a social media platform that allow users to share text, images, and videos with fiends and followers. The platform can have features such as lkes, comments, and sharing, as well as privacy settings and a user profile system.

Online marketplace: Develop an online marketplace that connects buyers and sellers of goods and services. The marketplace can have feature such as search and filter, messaging, and payment processing.


# Progress

I have already worked on my old CPT project from last trimester that works for time management
From first trimester we have created a social media platform as well that we can work to implement pictures. So far it is only text and blogs
 

One other idea that I have is some type of calculator that can do complex calculations maybe for physics.
