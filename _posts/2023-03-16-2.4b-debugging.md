# Debugging
Debugging is a very important step and it allows programmers to see a lot about their function and variables while debugging. I now understand why it is a valuable tool and why it is important to use while developing programs.

In the image, we can see the debugging right as the app object will be created. We will be seeing the properties which can be defined within the app object.!

We can see the User objects being created. The VSCode interface shows the variables for the class and how each user has their own specific values for the class blueprint.

By stepping into the function, we can see what is going on during the creation of the user. We step into the function and see how the initialization of the user is done.

This step is checked for the try portion and checks if the user is created. For this case, I had already created the users, so it would go into the except step.

This screenshot shows the results of the schema being created. It uses the cursor object which has many function and special variables. This is the same for the connection objects. These objects are removed from the debugging interface after the code which closes them executes, showing that these objects close their connection after the code tells them to. This shows why the closing step is important, so it turns off the connection and reduces the resources needed.
