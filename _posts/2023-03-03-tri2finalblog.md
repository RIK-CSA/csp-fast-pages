## Final Thoughts and Blogging

- Final exam wasn't too bad when working with classmates
- Most of it was pretty common sense to us
    - Digital security
    - Unethical uses of computer resources
    - Multifactor Authentication
- Other parts were just simple math and following directions
    - follow along with what a program is doing
    - Re-write a program with less complexity
    - Tell a robot what to do in order to move to a certain spot on a grid
