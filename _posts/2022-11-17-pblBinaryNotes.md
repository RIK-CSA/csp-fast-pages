- Front matter
    - example of METADATA (data about the data)
    - data about the post, not in the post
        - Humans have names (data about them)
        - Human names are not inside a person
- LIQUID: Code that exits in the programming environment, but gets converted to something else when sent to the browser
    - Code makeover (occurs in GitHub actions / GitHub pages build)
