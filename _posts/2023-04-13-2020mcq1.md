# Corrections:
## Question 4:

Answer choice D, which states that "the program cannot represent integers; the integers are converted into decimal approximations, leading to rounding errors", is incorrect because while fractions are sometimes represented by decimal approximations that are subject to rounding errors, integers are not. Answer choice C, which states that "the program can only use a fixed number of bits to represent integers; the computed sum is greater than the maximum representable value", is correct because overflow errors occur when an arithmetic operation results in a value outside the range of numbers that can be represented by a fixed number of bits.
## Question 6:

Answer choice D, which states that neither program I nor program II correctly moves the robot to the gray square, is incorrect because program I correctly moves the robot to the gray square by repeatedly moving the robot forward, rotating left, moving forward twice, and rotating right. Program II correctly moves the robot to the gray square by moving the robot forward to the bottom right corner of the grid, rotating left, moving the robot forward to the upper right corner of the grid, rotating left, and moving forward to the gray square. Answer choice C, which states that both program I and program II correctly move the robot to the gray square, is correct because Program I correctly moves the robot to the gray square by repeatedly moving the robot forward, rotating left, moving forward twice, and rotating right. Program II correctly moves the robot to the gray square by moving the robot forward to the bottom right corner of the grid, rotating left, moving the robot forward to the upper right corner of the grid, rotating left, and moving forward to the gray square.
## Question 10:

Answer choice D is incorrect because this code segment initially sets cost to 6, then increases cost by 2 for people who are either going on a guided tour or whose age is greater than 12. Because of the ELSE statement, the cost is not properly set for people who are both older than 12 and going on a guided tour. Answer choice B is correct because this code segment initially sets cost to 6 (the cheapest possible ticket price), then increases cost by 2 for people whose age is greater than 12. Regardless of the person’s age, cost is increased by 2 for people going on a guided tour.
## Question 15:

Answer choice C, which states that Program A and program B display the same number of values, but the values differ, is incorrect because while the two programs initialize i to different values, the same values are printed inside the loop because program A prints i and then increments it and program B increments i and then prints it. Answer choice A, which Program A and program B display identical values in the same order, is correct because Program A initializes i to 1. Inside the loop, it prints i and then increments i. The loop terminates when i is greater than 10, which occurs after 10 is printed. Program A prints 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10. Program B initializes i to 0. Inside the loop, it increments i and then prints i. The loop terminates when i equals 10, which occurs after 10 is printed. Program B prints 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10.
## Question 36:

Answer choice B, which states that the updated model is likely to decrease the runtime of the simulation because simulations that use older models tend to require more time to run than simulations that use newer models, is incorrect because whether the model is older or newer is not related to the amount of time it will take to run a simulation. Answer choice A, which states that the updated model is likely to decrease the runtime of the simulation because the time required for simulations generally depends on the complexity of the model used, is correct because the time required for a simulation to run is impacted by the level of detail used in the model. Generally, a simulation based on a less detailed model will require less time to run.
## Question 53:

Answer choice A, which states that a mobile application and collar that uses GPS technology to determine the pet’s location and transmits the location when the owner refreshes the application, is incorrect because this system uses GPS technology to find a lost pet, rather than the contributions of many individuals. Answer choice C, which states that a mobile application that allows users to report the location of a pet that appears to be lost and upload a photo that is made available to other users of the application is correct because this system uses an application to enlist the services of a large number of people to help find a lost pet.
