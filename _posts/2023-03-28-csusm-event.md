# CSUSM Programs Event 
# Notes/Insights
- Don’t let failures define you, an ambassador spoke on how she failed a lot of classes in college but it didn't deter her path at all. I thought it was really interesting that she got a D in AP Physics but didn't care about the grade and only focused on how much she enjoyed learning the subject. It was really inspiring because after I got a B in the second trimester of BC, I thought I wasn't suited for a career in STEM even though I liked math (and was extremely good at competition math). At the end of the day, if you're good at a subject but hate it, it's a lot harder to grow into loving something rather than starting off weaker but building your skill. 
- Computer science is relevant in every field, ambassador used python even as an applied major to read data for her applied physics labs. 
- Apply for jobs and internships even if you feel under qualified → you learn by doing, you are going to learn a lot while working in that job. Oftentimes, employers are looking for a strong foundation of basic skills and a combination of soft skills like working well with people, detail orientedness, etc. 
- Ask faculty and others to look over your work, it is always better to have a second pair of eyes provide feedback as they probably noticed something that you didn't. This reminded me the importance of showing others my work in computer science, I like to look at other people's hacks and share my own work with people outside of my group because it inspires me to make changes to my own code. I used to do this a lot in past trimesters, and will try doing it more again. 
- It seems like the college you attend doesn't seem to matter as much as I thought it did. In fact, I noticed it's really hard for some of my friends right now who attend prestigious universities and UC's to find internships because it's super competitive and hard to get to know your professor in a big class. CSUSM, although it is a much smaller school, it seems to provide a lot of opportunities and attention for its students. A big name for a university doesn't matter as much if you haven't done any real projects or hands-on work.

- Quantum Bridge Program: A 4-week program for admitted CSUSM students interested in learning more about quantum science

## General Helpful College Info + Terms
- Avoid internships when they are unpaid because you don’t need to worry about financial and can pursue interests at the same time 
- Grant- government funded 
- scholarship- private
- loans are divided between unsubsidized and subsidized loans, the latter being funded by the government

- Don't pay for your PHD because you’re providing a lot research 
- fafsa, studentaid.gov, help find scholarships/grants
- life after csusm continue onto graduate school and other professional programs/ a career in biomedical, environmental, chemical, and electronics fields.
