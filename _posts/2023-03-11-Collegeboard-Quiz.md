This quiz wasn't particularly hard and was pretty easy, the questions were easy and the wording made sense.

This quiz was also pretty easy, but, one question I had some problems with was question 4.

What made this question a little bit challenging was that I was overthinking it, thinking that maybe the tickets for each of the different artists could be different but I just went with the best possible answer.
