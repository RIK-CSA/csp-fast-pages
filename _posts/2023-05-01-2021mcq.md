Answer B, which states that "first = 100, second = 200", is incorrect. The variable second, while initially assigned the value 200, is later assigned the value of temp, which is 100.
Answer A, which states that "first = 100, second = 100", is correct. The variable first is initially assigned the value 100 and the variable second is initially assigned the value 200. Next, temp is assigned the value of first, which is 100. Next, second is assigned the value of temp, which is 100. Last, first is assigned the value of second, which is 100. After execution, both first and second have the value 100.
## Question 12:

Answer D is incorrect. For each iteration of the loop, this code segment moves the robot forward if there is an open square in front of the robot. Otherwise, the robot rotates left. In the first five iterations of the loop, the robot moves forward five squares to the top of the grid. In the next two iterations of the loop, the robot rotates left two times. In the next five iterations of the loop, the robot moves forward five squares to the bottom of the grid. In the next two iterations of the loop, the robot rotates left two times. The robot continues in an infinite loop, repeatedly moving from the bottom of the grid to the top of the grid and back.
Answer C is correct. For each iteration of the loop, this code segment rotates the robot left if there is an open square to its left. Then, whether or not the robot rotates left, the code segment attempts to move the robot forward one square. In the first three iterations of the loop, the robot moves forward three squares from its initial location. In the next iteration of the loop, it rotates left. In the next three iterations of the loop, it moves forward three squares. In the next iteration of the loop, it rotates left. In the last three iterations of the loop, it moves forward three squares to the gray square at the bottom left corner of the grid.
## Question 23:

Answer C, which states that "The Internet requires all communications to use encryption protocols.", is incorrect. The Internet was not designed to be completely secure. Encryption is not required for communications.
Answer B, which states that "The Internet is designed to scale to support an increasing number of users.", is correct. The Internet was designed to be scalable, using open protocols to easily connect additional computing devices to the network.
## Question 63:

Answer B, which states that "(NOT input1) AND (NOT input2)", incorrect. For example, when input1 is true and input2 is false, then (NOT input1) will be false and (NOT input2) will be true. Therefore, (NOT input1) AND (NOT input2) will be false instead of the intended value true.
Answer A, which states that "(NOT input1) OR (NOT input2)", is correct. When input1 and input2 are both true, the expressions (NOT input1) and (NOT input2) are both false, so (NOT input1) OR (NOT input2) will evaluate to false. In all other cases, either (NOT input1) or (NOT input2) (or both) will evaluate to true, so (NOT input1) OR (NOT input2) will evaluate to true.
## Question 69:

Answer A, which states that "Determining the chronological order of the photos", is correct. The time and date that a photo is taken is considered metadata about the image. This information can be used to determine the chronological order of the images.
Answer D, which states that "Determining whether two photos were taken at the same location on different days", is correct. The location and date that a photo is taken is considered metadata about the image. This information can be used to determine whether two pictures were taken at the same location on different dates.
