# Results
I scored a 23/25, which is a 92% which is more than a 90% and should guarantee me a 0.9+

# Corrections
## Question 2

For question number 2, I chose option choice A, which is "A lossless compression algorithm can guarantee that compressed information is kept secure, while a lossy compression algorithm cannot.", which is incorrect because the ability to keep data secure is not a primary function of a compression algorithm.
Instead, the right answer is option choice B, which is "A lossless compression algorithm can guarantee reconstruction of original data, while a lossy compression algorithm cannot.", which is correct because lossless compression algorithms are guaranteed to be able to reconstruct the original data, while lossy compression algorithms are not.
## Question 21

For question number 21, I chose option choice C, which is "Sort by subject, then sort by year, then filter by photographer", which is incorrect because this sequence of steps does not remove any entries with an unknown year, so the entry in the first row of the spreadsheet will have a year value of -1.
Instead, the right answer is option choice D, which is "Sort by year, then filter by year, then filter by photographer", which is correct because sorting by year will sort the spreadsheet on column C from least to greatest. Filtering by year will remove any entries with unknown years. Filtering by photographer will remove any entries with unknown photographers. Since the order of the entries is not affected by the filters, the photograph with the lowest year value will be in the first row of the spreadsheet.
