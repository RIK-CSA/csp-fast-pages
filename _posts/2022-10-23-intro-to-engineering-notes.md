# Important Notes/Lessons
- When it comes to engineering, there is an extensive use of science, math, logic, and algorithms to solve problems
- Engineering can change the world (and has a good salary!), which inspired Suma to pursue a career in that field (specifically electronics and communication)
- There are a variety of streams you can take with engineering, such as biomedical, aerospace, software, electronics and communication, and many more
- Suma's very first job made her nervous at first, but over time, it became easier to mingle with the other students and share exepriences with one another
- Qualcomm is a corporation that creates services related to networking and wireless technology
    - Designs wireless telecommunications products
    - Integrated GPUs
    - Artifical intelligence products
    - Inventors of CDM technology
    - Wants to bring benefits of mobiles to other domains of engineering
    - It is more than just sitting in front of a laptop!
    - Volunteering + fun team activities
- Nisha - director of engineering at Qualcomm
- As a kid, Nisha was fascinated by how engineers made useful, innovative products
- Fell in love with computer-related engineering because of how well she was doing in math in high school
- Initially did not know what she was doing going into engineering
- Excited to move to San Diego because that was a city where Qualcomm existed and where the headquarters of her team company were

# Questions

How do you know what side of engineering you want to pursue (software, hardware, etc.)
- Keep a growth mindest! 
- It is important to know what you love
- It can be hard to know what your interests are, so it is a good idea to do some research and see what fields resonate the most with you
- More exposure may allow you to narrow down some of the things that you like the most

What is the difference between software and hardware engineering?
- Hardware - designs the electronics, develop chips using languages
- Software - write the software for the electronics

What universities specialize in software engineering? 
- Most universities with engineering will have a software engineering field (i.e. cpmputer science)
- In Calfiornia, we have many universities with great university programs

What are majors that would help me learn the necessary skills and concepts to get a software developer job in tech app companies?
- Any tech company (Google, Amazon, Apple, etc.) looks for software engineers

What should I do in high school to increase my chances to get admitted into these universities?

- Challenge yourself when you are in school
- Go above and beyond, take honors classes
- Take some community college classes in your junior and senior years of high school
- Colleges look very closely at acadmeic rigor

What is one thing you wish you had done earlier that would have greatly helped you with engineering?

- Take advantage of any programs that your school may have
- This way, you will be better prepared for engineering

What were some of your biggest challenges and how did you handle them?

- When Suma gave birth to her first kid, she had to focus on her kid
- Difficult for her to balance between motherhood and work, but with time, she got better at it
- Back then, one could not Google resources to help them with engineering

What are some competitions that I can participate in where I can apply what I have learned?

- See if you can join the first Robotics program
- Try to find a team in the community that you live in
- Gaming companies in San Diego (i.e. Rocket League)

# Personal Takeaways from the Event

After attending the event, I was really fascinated to listen to each of the engineers' stories, as hearing them made me realize that the journey to become an engineer is a lot of work. I also liked hearing the speakers talk about Qualcomm, as personally, my dad has worked there as a software engineer for many years. Overall, this event has inspired me to possibly pursue a career in some type of engineering, as I know that there are many of opportunities for aspiring engineers like me.
