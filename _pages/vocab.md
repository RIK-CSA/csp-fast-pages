- syntax error: A mistake in typed code that violates the rules of the programming language. Typically, code with syntax errors will not run.
- logic error: A mistake in an algorithm or program that causes it to behave unexpectedly or return the incorrect value.
- run-time error: A mistake in a program that happens only when the program is actually run, such as a program attempting to access memory that does not exist.
- overflow error: Error that results when the number of bits is not enough to represent the number (like a car’s odometer “rolling over”).
